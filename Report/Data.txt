The data provided contains information on all tyeps of vehicle collision in Seattle from the year 2004 to present. In order to predict the probability of an accident based on different road and weather conditions, in this research, the following data from the data set will be used:

-	Severitycode; this piece of data rates the severity of accidents with a numeric value from 0 â€“ 3, where 0 represents unknown, 1 for property damage, 2 for injury, 2b for serious injury and 3 for fatalities. We can use these values to predict the severity of various accidents in different conditions. For example to predict serious injuries in good weather and road conditions.

-	Personcount, Pedcount, pedclycount and vehcount. These relates to the number of people, pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles involved in the collision.  By using these pieces of data, we will be able to see the secondary impact of the collision. Predictions can be made so as to have the least secondary impact in a possible accident. For example, we could be able to predict the likelihood of a car accident on a clear day where less than 10 people will be hurt/involved.

-	Injuries, SeriousInjuries and Fatalities. As the names suggest, this indicate the number of injuries, serious injuries and fatalities involved in a collision. It generally tells of how sever the accident could be. These types of data are very useful when creating our model because they will be used as indicators in every accident in a given weather and road condition. As a demonstration, we will be able to predict how likely it would be for a fatal accident on a clear day with relatively good road conditions.

-	Weather, Roadcond and Lightcond. These indicate the weather, road condition and light condition at the time of the collision. We can view these as important causal factors of the accident and therefore they can be modelled so as to identify which factor/s could have the highest influence in the probability of a collision. For example, we could be able to model the likelihood of collisions during bad weather on a road which is in poor condition during a time where the light is poor. By knowing the probability and the magnitude of an accident of this type, we could then put measures in place to reduce the impact or loss of life.

-	Collisiontype; This describes the type of collision during the accident. It provides further information on the make up of the accident and will be useful to isolate any trends which we may find. For example, we could show if there are more accidents involving parked cars on storm days.
